The project aims at recreating the classic 15 puzzle game in python and prompt the user to solve it. It involves the study the mathematical principles involved in the puzzle and their implementation. This can be extended to the implementation of other slide and go puzzles like a picture puzzle. In a picture puzzle a picture is split into a squared grid. The objective is to rearrange these tiles to obtain the original picture. There are a lot of grid puzzles that can be obtained in this way. Construction of a magic square, 2048 puzzle, 4 in a row, tic-tac-toe and even checkers and chess can be constructed in this way. These puzzles are not only fun, but also develop essential logical and quick thinking skills in an individual.
Such skills are essential for problem solving and hence contribute to the overall development.
